      The version of Nix that should be installed

      If not specified, the latest stable Nix release is used. Note that each
      release of nix-quick-install-action has a specific set of supported
      Nix versions, which do not change. You can check what Nix versions are
      supported by the version of nix-quick-install-action you're using by
      going to https://github.com/nixbuild/nix-quick-install-action/releases

  nix_conf:
    required: false
    description: |
      If set, this configuration is written to a new file which is then added to
      the NIX_USER_CONF_FILES environment variable. You can also set that
      variable yourself to control the Nix configuration.

  nix_on_tmpfs:
    required: true
    default: false
    description: |
      Installs /nix on a tmpfs mount. This can make Nix operations faster, but
      you risk running out of memory if your Nix store grows to big. Only
      enable this if you're absolutely sure the size of your Nix store (and
      database, logs etc) will be considerably less than the available memory.
      This option does nothing on MacOS runners.

  nix_archives_url:
    required: false

      Don't use. For bootstrapping purposes only.
